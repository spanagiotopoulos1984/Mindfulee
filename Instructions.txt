Mindfulee
HealthyGamer GG hackathon project
Project Members: stormlord_, fruitcakette

To run this web application, the following technologies are required:
- Java Version 16 or higher (OpenJDK and Azul Zulu JDK tested)
- PostgreSQL version 16.1 or higher
- Wildfly 31 or higher (a compressed archive with my testing wildfly is provided)

1. Create a mindfulee database in PostgreSQL and import the mindfulee_db.sql script inside the scripts folder.
This creates test and dummy data from development, and the user is test_user with password 123456!a
2. Go to {wildlfly_path}/standalone/configuration and find the standalone.xml. Find the subsystem datasources,
and change the PostgreSQL datasource with the desired ip, port, username and password.
3. If you want to run the application outside of localhost, go to Interface Binding, and change the public IP to the
appropriate address (0.0.0.0 if you want to use the server's IP)
4. If required, go to socket-binding and change the http port to a free port.
5. Copy the mindfulee-1.0.war from the files folder inside the {wildlfly_path}/standalone/deployments folder.
6. Create an empty mindfulee-1.0.war.dodeploy file. If you have renamed the war, use the new war's name instead!
7. Wait a few seconds, and the application should deploy. If not, please send me a message to help you with
the process.
